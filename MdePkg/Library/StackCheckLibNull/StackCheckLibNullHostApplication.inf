## @file
#  Null library instance for StackCheckLib which can be included
#  when a build needs to include stack check functions but does
#  not want to generate stack check failures. This instance is used
#  for HOST_APPLICATIONS specifically, as MSVC host applications link
#  to the C runtime lib that contains the stack cookie definitions, so
#  must link to a completely null version of this lib, whereas GCC host
#  host applications do not link to a C runtime lib that contains the stack
#  cookie definitions, so we must link against our version.
